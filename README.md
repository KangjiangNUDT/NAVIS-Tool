# NAVIS Tool
Neuromorphic Auditory Visualizer Tool

This software presents diverse utilities to perform the post-processing step of the information obtained by a neuromorphic cochlea. Using the information contained in aedat files generated with the jAER software a set of graphs are implemented which allow us to represent auditory information like the cochleogram, histogram, sonogram, etc. NAVIS also implements some functionalities that are able to split the auditory information from an aedat file into several others based on the activity level of the cochlea. The power of this software tool allows complex audio post-processing treatments and representation, which is a novelty inside the Neuromorphic community and can help neuromorphic engineers to build train sets for spiking neural networks (SNN).
