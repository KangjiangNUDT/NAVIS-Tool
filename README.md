This software presents diverse utilities to develop the first post-processing layer using the neuromorphic auditory sensors (NAS) information. The NAS used implements a cascade filters architecture in FPGA, imitating the behavior of the basilar membrane and inner hair cells, working with the sound information decomposed into its frequency components as spike streams. The neuromorphic hardware interface Address-Event-Representation (AER) is used to propagate auditory information out of the NAS, emulating the auditory vestibular nerve. Using the packetized information (aedat files) generated with jAER software plus an AER to USB computer interface, NAVIS implements a set of graphs that allows to represent the auditory information as cochleograms, histograms, sonograms, etc. It can also split the auditory information into different sets depending on the activity level of the spike streams. The main contribution of this software tool is its capability to apply complex audio post-processing treatments and representations, which is a novelty for spike-based systems in the neuromorphic community. This software will help neuromorphic engineers to build sets for the training of spiking neural networks (SNN).</p>
